This is my code portfolio from projects I've completed in and outside of school. 
Here are descriptions of each project.


Assignment3 cs570 Operating Systems is a C++ project created during an Operating Systems class at San Diego State University. We used p_threads to simulate an alarm clock that counts down from a user inputted number of seconds.
	We learned more about how to create and work with pthreads. We also learned how to use signals to control thread termination.


CS320Assignment2 is a C++ project created during a Programming Languages class at San Diego State University. The most impressive of the files in this directory is prog_2_3.

  prog2_3 takes one command line argument from STDIN representing the number of times the user may "push" and "pop" tokens onto or off of the stack. After the user pushes or pops however many tokens they specified, or if they type "quit", the stack is then printed onto the screen.


SQL is a folder made up of all of the projects done in Database Theory Implementation class at San Diego State University.
